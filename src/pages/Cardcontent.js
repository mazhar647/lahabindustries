        Quality of Cement is important because the strength of the cement reduces with age, We grow old with the strength hence we deliver the fine quality of Cement. { " " } <

        Crushed stone is one of the most accessible natural resources, and is a major basic raw material used by construction, agriculture,
        and other industries.Despite the low value of its basic products,
        the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and an indicator of the economic well - being of a nation.The demand
        for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand
        for construction materials. { " " } <

        Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand - sized particles by mass.[2] The composition of sand varies,
        depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non -
        tropical coastal settings is silica(silicon dioxide, or SiO2),
        usually in the form of quartz. { " " } <

        Manufactured sand or manufactured fine aggregate(MFA) is produced by reducing larger pieces of aggregate into sand - sized aggregate particles.Manufactured sands tend to be used in mixtures in areas where natural sand is not available or not cost effective to be hauled to the needed location { " " } <
